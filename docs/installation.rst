A functioning python environment (>=3.7) is necessary to run this package.

This package uses the tensorflow (>=2.1.0) and tensorflow-probability (>=0.9.0) packages.

- Clone the repository from (Github)[https://github.com/johannesostner/SCDCdm_public]
- Navigate to the root directory of SCDCdm
- Install SCDCdm::
